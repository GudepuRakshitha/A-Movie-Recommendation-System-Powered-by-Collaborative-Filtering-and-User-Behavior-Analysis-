# A Movie Recommendation System Powered by Collaborative Filtering and User Behavior Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a personalized **Movie Recommendation System** that leverages **collaborative filtering** and **user behavior analysis**. It provides tailored movie suggestions by analyzing user ratings, preferences, and similarities with other users. The system is designed to be modular, scalable, and adaptable to real-world applications.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🎯 **Collaborative Filtering** – Suggests movies based on user-user or item-item similarity
- 🧠 **User Behavior Analysis** – Understands user preferences from historical data
- 📊 **Scalable Recommendation Engine** – Easily integrates with real-time systems
- 🛠️ **Modular Code Structure** – Clean and reusable Python modules
- 🖼️ Optional **Streamlit UI** – Interactive and user-friendly interface

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍  
- Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation  
- Scikit-learn – Similarity computation  
- Streamlit – Web app (optional)  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn – Visualizations  
- Jupyter Notebook – Prototyping & EDA  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Data Loading** – Reads movie and ratings datasets.
2. **Preprocessing** – Filters data, handles sparsity, and formats ratings.
3. **Similarity Calculation** – Computes user or item similarity using cosine similarity.
4. **Prediction Engine** – Generates movie recommendations not yet watched by the user.
5. **Ranking & Display** – Outputs top-N recommended movies with scores.

To launch the Streamlit demo:

```bash
pip install streamlit
streamlit run app.py

## sample output
